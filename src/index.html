      <p class="center-align">
       Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an
        existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing
        its external behavior. Its heart is a series of small behavior
        preserving transformations. Each transformation (called a "refactoring")
        does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a
        significant restructuring. Since each refactoring is small, it's less
        likely to go wrong. The system is kept fully working after each
        refactoring, reducing the chances that a system can get seriously broken
        during the restructuring. Martin Fowler
